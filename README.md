# Implementation-Columnar-Transposition-Cipher
The columnar transposition cipher is a fairly simple, easy to implement cipher. It is a transposition cipher that follows a simple rule for mixing up the characters in the plaintext to form the ciphertext.  Although weak on its own, it can be combined with other ciphers, such as a substitution cipher, the combination of which can be more difficult to break than either cipher on it's own.
